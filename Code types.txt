Codetypes for Dnawrkshp's NetCheat PS3:

Format:
[COMMAND][ARGS] [ADDRESS] [VALUE]

---------- 0 -- X Byte Write
Writes X number of bytes to a (address)

0 aaaaaaaa vvvvvv
You can have as many bytes after it (no spaces, new lines, and must have even number of digits)
0102030405 would work, but 010203040 would not

Example:
0 00B1F4A1 FFFFFF01FFFFFF02FFFFFF03

---------- 1 -- Text write
Writes the text to a (address)
The text can contain spaces so be sure to not have comments on the same line

1 aaaaaaaa TEXT

Example:
1 00B1F4A6 This is an example of a text write

---------- 2 -- Float write
Writes the float to a (address)

2 aaaaaaaa float

Example:
2 00B1F4A0 -3.14159

---------- 4 -- Multi/Condensed write
Starting at a, the value v is written and then a is incremented by the value i. This is done c many times.
So if you look at the example below, the start address is 00B36E40.
It then writes FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to 00B36E40 and increments by 00000010 (i).
So the address becomes 00B36E50 and FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF is written there.
That happens 0x27 times, which if you do the math, will end at 00B36E40 + (0x27 * 0x10) or 00B370B0.
This is the alternative to having a huge X write that, in this case, would be 0x270 bytes in length

4 aaaaaaaa vvvv
4 iiiiiiii cc

Example:
4 00B36E40 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
4 00000010 27

---------- 6 -- Pointer write
Reads the value at a, adds o, then uses that as the address for the next line.
a = address, o = offset, c = command, v = value

6 aaaaaaaa oooooooo
c 00000000 vvvvvvvv

Example:
6 00B611C4 000010FC
0 00000000 424800003F800000

---------- B -- Find/Replace
Searches the memory starting at a and going until b is reached.
If COUNT is given and is greater than 0, the search will last until the number of replaces is equal to COUNT, or if b is reached.
For every instance of o (aka OGP) found, it will be replaced with n (COP).
Both o and n should be the same length.
Game regions are used in the searching, so to make the code faster do specify/find/import the game's regions in the Range tab.

Because of how complicated the use of this can be in regard to multiple codes using the same o (OGP) value... I've added another window to help manage the find/replace results
If you got a code from somewhere but it is in OGP/COP format (no start/stop specified), just use the first region for the game (Range tab->Find Ranges).

B[COUNT] aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbb
B oooooooo nnnnnnnn

Example:
-- All within region
B 00010000 01CC0000
B 1234567890ABCDEF FEDCBA0987654321
-- First 4 found
B4 00010000 FFFFFFFC
B 1234567890ABCDEF FEDCBA0987654321

---------- D -- Equal To Comparison
Reads the number of bytes v contains from a and compares it with v. If they are equal it will execute the count (hex) number of lines below it.
D type codes must be constantly written!

D[COUNT] aaaaaaaa vvvvvvvv

Example:
D1 00B122F8 0001000000000000
0 009C356D 00006000

---------- E -- comparison mask unset
Reads the number of bytes v contains from a and ands it with v. If that logical AND v is equal to v it will execute the count number (hex) of lines below it.
So pretty much if the bits in v, are set in a, it will execute. D comparisons will execute if the bits in v are the only bits set at a.
if ((intB & intA) == intA) From misc.ArrayCompare
E type codes must be constantly written!

E[COUNT] aaaaaaaa vvvvvvvv

Example:
E2 00B122F8 00000044
0 010D4568 3E000000
1 0125CCA4 Activated

---------- F -- Copy bytes
Reads COUNT number of bytes from a and stores it in b

F[COUNT] aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbb

Example:
FC0 00B00000 00C00000
