NetCheat PS3 4.40

Compile:
	Written in Visual Studio 2012 (C#)
	Uses Telerik for Codelist GUI
	I use CryptoObfuscator to merge the telerik and Ionic.Zip dlls into NC

Run:
	If you want to use the Target Manager API, just install the ProDG TM v420.1.14.7
	If you want to use the Control Console API, place it in the same directory (comes with NC)
	In the options form check what API you'd like to use once setup
	
Tips:
	Double click on a plugin to open/close it
	Double click a code to toggle constant write
	Ctrl-C on result(s) will copy them into the clipboard in code format
	Search results do not automatically refresh
	When you test a subroutine and you want to update it after already writing it, click Reset Written
		Then you can replace the code and write again without a possible freeze

If you want to make a plugin I suggest watching my tutorial on how:

Enjoy.
